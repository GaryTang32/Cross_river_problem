# Cross_river_problem
This is the first problem i solved with python, which is a cabbage, sheep and wolf cross river game. There is 2 methodology. One of them is the original flow that i will consider the boatman at each stage to make decision. Another is to not consider about the stage of the boat man and make the correct decision base on the cabbage, sheep and wolf only.
